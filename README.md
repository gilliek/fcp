**Notice:** FCP is still in development and may contain some bugs.

# FCP

FCP stands for FTP Copy. It aims to be a simple CLI tool that performs copy
through FTP.

# Installation

Copy `bin/fcp` into one of your bin folder (eg. `/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`,
or `~/.bin`). Make sure that the path is in your `$PATH`.

# Usage (TODO)

See `fcp -h` or `fcp --help`

# Tests

To run the test suite, use `rake test` from the root of the project.
